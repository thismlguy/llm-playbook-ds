# llm-playbook-ds
---------

This repository lists helpful resources for data scientists to start incorporating LLMs into their daily workflows. Engineers have been using
Github-Copilot to increase their efficiency by more than 50%, why should data scientists be left behind?

The resources are structured into 2 formats:
- [Examples](/examples) in the form of jupyter notebooks
- [Learning Path](/LEARNING-PATH.md) which lists the steps you can take to start using LLMs in your daily workflow

## Examples

Examples are present in the form of notebooks:
- [Code Generation: data science salaries case study](examples/ds-salaries-code-generation.ipynb)
- [Information Extraction: JioMart case study](examples/jiomart-product-metadata-extraction.ipynb)
- [Text Summarization: Delta Air Lines twitter customer support case study](examples/delta-airlines-twitter-analysis.ipynb)


## Contributing Examples

Contributions are welcome! You could contribute other example notebooks following a similar pattern.
Please use the template followed in existing notebooks.
- Start with a title section with a summary of analysis being performed
- Add a `Data Sources` section with links/details to the data files required to replicate the notebook
- Add a `Environment Setup` section with instructions to setup the environment required to run the notebook. List down the packages used along with
versions
